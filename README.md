# TitanicClassification
## Titanic passenger survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
## Procedure 
1. **Data Loading: Load Titanic dataset from 'train.csv', including survival status.

2. **Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, drop 'Cabin', convert 'Age' and 'Embarked', and encode categorical features.

3. **Data Visualization: Create count plots using seaborn to understand data distribution and feature relationships.

4. **Data Splitting: Divide data into features and target labels, then split into training and testing sets.

5. **Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model using training data.

6. **Model Evaluation: Make predictions on training and testing sets, calculate accuracy scores for evaluation.
